# Dice Roller App 🎲
**Course:** Mobile Application Development (Android/Kotlin) — Fall 2025  
**Student:** Tugba Agdas

---

## Project Overview
This is my version of the Dice Roller App rebuilt from the tutorial playlist.  
The app allows the user to roll two dice and see random results.  
Each roll updates both dice images and shows the total of the two numbers.  
I also added animation and a dark modern theme for better user experience.

## Features
- Two dice that change randomly when pressed
- Smooth rolling animation using XML rotation
- Clean dark mode layout
- Dynamic total display
- Built with Kotlin and XML layouts

---

##  Technical Details
- **Language:** Kotlin
- **Layout:** XML (LinearLayout)
- **Animation:** XML rotate animation (`dice_roll.xml`)
- **All strings and colors** use Android resources (`strings.xml` and `colors.xml`)
- **Compatible with Android SDK 36**

---

## Enhancement Added
Compared to the tutorial baseline, I improved the app with:
1. A **rolling animation** when the button is pressed
2. A **dark mode color theme** for modern UI
3. **Clean resource structure** (no hard-coded text or color values)
